# MonsterCorePDFMapping

Provide a mapping in Foundry VTT for artwork extracted from the Monster Core PDF using the [MonsterCore-Image-Extractor](https://github.com/MostTornBrain/MonsterCore-Image-extractor).
This requires you have copied the extracted images from the PDF into your Foundry installation in the folder `data/monster-core-images`.

This is a frugal approach to getting artwork into Foundry for the Monster Core, assuming you already own the [Monster Core PDF](https://paizo.com/products/btq02ex5?Pathfinder-Monster-Core).  It will map all the PDF images as both token and actor artwork.

If you do NOT own the Moster Core PDF, this process will not be useful.  Paizo sells a [token pack](https://paizo.com/products/btq02eat?Pathfinder-Tokens-Bestiaries) for all the monster images from their three Bestiaries and this has the added benefit of having both token artwork and portrait artwork for the monsters.
